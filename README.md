# Surfs_Up

# PURPOSE:
The purpose of this analysis to provide insights into the temperature data for June and December months in Oahu, to determine if the 'surf & Ice-cream shop' business is sustainable year-round. 

# RESULTS:

Temperatures for June and December have been extracted from the SQLlite DB from all weather stations and converted into two DataFrames. Key analysis from these Dataframes have been derived to understand wethere the business is sustainable.

### Statistics derived from Dataframe created for June:

# SUMMARY:

### From the above results, minimum temperature for June months is 64 and maximum 85.
### Similarly, for the month of December, minimum temperature is 56 and maximum 83.
### Standard deviation for both months is about 0.5 and this indicates the difference between both seasons.

## With these observations and the climate analysis attached with this project, opening a surf and Ice-cream shop in Oahu is not going to be a risky one as anticipated.
